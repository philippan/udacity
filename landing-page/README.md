# Landing Page Project

## Introduction

The Landing Page project is a development exercise to gain familiarity with common DOM interfaces, properties, and methods and when to the use them to scale code and enhance the user experience. These include:

* .addEventListener()
* .querySelector()
* for...of loop
* template literals
* .setTimeout()

## Active Sections

One challenge was letting users know which section they were on. I used the .addEventListener() to trigger a function `` that would check if a section were in a viewport. After that another function decides whether More than one section, however, could be in the viewport at once.
